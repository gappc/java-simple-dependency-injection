# Simple example implementation of a dependency injection framework

This project contains a very simple example implementation of a dependency injection framework.

The code is intended for learning and demonstration purposes only!

## Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gappc/java-simple-dependency-injection.git
```

Build the project with Maven:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Run the main class:

```bash
java -cp target/simple-dependency-injection-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar dev.gappc.example.di.Main
```

As a result, you'll see the output of several service invocations, where each service was instantiated using the dependency injection framework.
